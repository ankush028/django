<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>

On its about us page, Yellow Leaf Hammocks does a fantastic job showing you how your purchase of one of its hammocks directly impacts the life of someone else -- the artisan weavers (and their families) who craft the hammocks.

What I love about this page is that it tells you what they are selling right away -- "Ridiculously comfy hammocks" -- then moves on quickly. The rest of the page is dedicated entirely to sharing the story of the artisan weavers.

Yellow Leaf Hammocks also makes it clear that it isn't a charity, but an organization about long-term sustainability and "community transformation." The use of real "employee" photos helps enhance this message and lets consumers see exactly who their purchase is impacting.
